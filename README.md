#This is a python program that reads a Arduino .ino file and then interprets its pinMode section into baremetal DDR instructions
#In future I will be updating and expanding it to convert more aspects of the ino file into baremetal code. 

# My ultimate goal is to create a piece of code which forms another copy of code file with baremetal code 
#snippets to increase the speed of code and reduce its code size.

#Uptill now it has the ability to read pinMode and also if there are any variable names inside the pinMode it can read that
#too except of #define constants will be working on it and making a commit regarding it soon. 

#I will really appreciate for your valuable feedback or queries regarding the aspects of code and 
#commits or improvement ideas.
